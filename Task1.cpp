/*

- Request use of the ADC by calling the requestADC() method of the ADC object. This call
passes an integer argument representing the channel to be sampled. The ADC has several channels
(initially six), each represented by an instance of AdcInputChannel. Assume that each thread
uses a unique AdcInputChannel. The thread should print out its identity when the call is
successful.

- Request a sample from the ADC by calling sampleADC(). This returns a double value on the
basis of the channel that was selected by the requestADC() call. To start with, simply make
the sampleADC() method return a value that is twice the channel number passed in the call to
requestADC().

- Print out its identity together with the sample value obtained from the ADC.

- Call releaseADC() to enable other threads to use the ADC, printing out its identity once more.

- Delay for a random time between 0.1 and 0.5 second.
